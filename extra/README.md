There are lots of great icon sets out there that can be used with the
Weather Desklet, but which I can't distribute with the desklet. This 
may be because of license restriction, or simply because the 
distribution file is getting too large.

You can download alternative icon sets yourself and place them in 
`icons/user` directory, along with a suitably edited `iconmeta.json`
file. For full details of the process see the 
[project wiki](https://github.com/tipichris/bbcwx/wiki/Using-your-own-icons)

This directory contains a collection of `iconmeta.json` files that can 
be used icon sets that are available to download
